            <dd> Engelbert Humperdinck hit it big with the song "Release Me (And Let Me Love Again)" in 1967,
                following up with seven consecutive number one hits. Humperdinck became a regular on the touring

            <dd>Born Arnold George Dorsey in Madras, India, on May 2, 1936, singer Engelbert Humperdinck scored
                several hits during the 1960s. He is the second youngest of 10 children born to Mervyn and Olive
                Dorsey; Humperdinck spent the first 11 years of his life in Madras, where his father worked as an
                engineer. In 1947, the future crooner moved with his family to England, where they settled in
                Leicester.

                A self-described dreamer and loner, Humperdinck dropped out of school at the age of 15. After a
                stint doing National Service in Germany, he began singing in men's clubs, but it was a hard way to
                make a living. Singing under the name Gerry Dorsey, Humperdinck scraped by financially. His
                financial pressures increased when he married his wife, Patricia. The couple eventually had four
                children together.</dd>

                    Evans, who left the family when Adele was only four years old.Evans remained in contact with his
                    daughter up until her teen years, when his problems with alcohol and increasing estrangement from
                    his daughter caused their relationship to deteriorate. By contrast, Adele grew close to her mom, who
