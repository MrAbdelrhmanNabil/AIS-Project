            <h4>Matthew David McConaughey (born November 4, 1969)<br>
                American actor and producer Matthew David McConaughey was born in Uvalde, Texas. His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe),
                 is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, 
                 was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business.<br>
                  He is of Irish, Scottish, German, English, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, 
                  where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father's oil business, 
                  which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, 
                  washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin,
                   originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book "The Greatest Salesman 
                   in the World" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film.
